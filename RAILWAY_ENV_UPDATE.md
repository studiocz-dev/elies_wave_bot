# 🚨 URGENT: Update Railway Environment Variables

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

The bot is generating signals but the **NEW API KEYS** are only in your local `.env` file!

Railway uses its own environment variables, which still have the **OLD (expired) API keys**.

---

## 🔧 How to Fix

### Step 1: Go to Railway Dashboard
1. Open: https://railway.app/
2. Log in to your account
3. Click on your project: **elies_wave_bot**
4. Click on the service (your bot)

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables
1. Click the **"Variables"** tab
2. Find these variables:
   - `BINANCE_API_KEY`
   - `BINANCE_API_SECRET`

### Step 3: Replace with New Keys
1. Click **Edit** next to each variable
2. Replace with your NEW API keys from `.env` file:

**From your `.env` file:**
```
BINANCE_API_KEY=MT33xWKzKYW143Z2vine... (your new key)
BINANCE_API_SECRET=... (your new secret)
```

### Step 4: Redeploy
1. After updating variables, click **"Redeploy"** or **"Restart"**
2. Railway will restart the bot with new API keys
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for bot to start

## ✅ How to Verify It Worked

### Check Logs:
After redeployment, you should see:
```
💰 Account Balance: $4995.02 USDT (Available: $4995.02)
```

And when signals are generated:
```
🎯 Attempting to execute trade for ADAUSDT 4h
🔵 EXECUTE_TRADE called for ADAUSDT 4h
   Step 1: Calculating position size...
   Step 2: Getting current price from Binance...
   ...
✅ MARKET order placed successfully!
   Order ID: 12345678
✅ STOP LOSS order placed! Order ID: 12345679
✅ TAKE PROFIT order placed! Order ID: 12345680
🎉 TRADE SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED! 🎉
```

## 📊 Current Status

**What's happening now:**
- ✅ Bot is running on Railway
- ✅ Signals are being generated (ADAUSDT had 2 signals)
- ❌ Orders are NOT being placed (still using old expired keys)
- ❌ New code deployed but using wrong API keys

**What we need:**
- Update Railway environment variables with NEW API keys
- Redeploy/restart the bot
- Then orders will be placed!

## 🎯 Quick Checklist

- [ ] Open Railway dashboard
- [ ] Go to Variables tab
- [ ] Update `BINANCE_API_KEY` with new key
- [ ] Update `BINANCE_API_SECRET` with new secret
- [ ] Click "Redeploy" or "Restart"
- [ ] Wait 2 minutes
- [ ] Check logs for "Account Balance: $4995" (not $4994)
- [ ] Wait for next signal
- [ ] Should see "TRADE SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED!"

## 💡 Alternative: Deploy Trigger

If you don't see a "Redeploy" button, you can force a deployment by making a small change:

```bash
# Make a dummy commit
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force Railway redeploy"
git push origin main
```

Railway will detect the push and redeploy automatically.

**After updating Railway environment variables, the bot will start placing REAL orders!** 🚀
